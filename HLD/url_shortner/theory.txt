1st phase is requirement analysis

- how short url should be - interviewer will say as short as possible
- traffic: 10million urls/day
- which are characters are allowed: 0-9, a-z, A-Z


How to generate hash value?
- hash function and Base62 encoding

- hash function
  - md5 and sha-1
    - md5 is 128 bit = 16 bytes
    - in hexadecimal base is 16 and can be represented in 4 bits becuase hexadeciamla is 0-f i.e 16 digits and
      16 can be represented in 4 bits.
    - 16 bytes means 32 hexadecimal
    - md5 will generate a character lenght of 32 but we require only 7
    - and sha-1 returns 160 bit which convertrs to 40 charterlength
    - now if we use hash function like md5 and sha1 we need to trim till 7 characters but this will increase the
      chance of collision.

- Base62(0-9a-zA-Z)(10+26+26 = 62)
