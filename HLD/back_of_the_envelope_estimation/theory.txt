Back of the envelope Estimation

- It drives our decision for various things like hom much should be of the cache, where to use CDn
cheatsheet
           Traffic      Storage
three 0    thousand      kb
6 0's      million       mb
9 0's      billion       gb
12 0's     Trillion      tb
15 0's     quadirillion  pb

char - 2 bytes
long/ double - 8 bytes
avg .Image size - 300Kb

x million users * y mb = x*y tb(million has 6 zeros and mb has 6 zeros = 12 0's represent tb)

- generally we have to calculate num. of servers, RAM, storage capacity using estimation and Trade off


Traffic Estimation of facebok
- total users - 20 billion 
- Daily active users - 250 million (25%)
- let us suppose users has 5R(read) + 3W(write) operations in a day 
- 250 million * 7 / 86000(~100000) = 18000 request per second
- DAU post 2 post each post 250 charactes
- 10% od DAU upload 1 image(300kb)
- for 1post = 250 * 2 = 500 bytes
- 250 million users * 1kb = 250 gb per day is required
- 25milion also posting image * 300kb = 7500 gb ~ 8 TB
- in 5 years  post = 2000(days in 5 years) * 250gb = 500Tb and image = 2000* 8 TB = 16PB


Ram Estimation
- for each user last 5 post in cache 5 * 500 bytes = 2500 bytes
- 250 million * 2500 ~ 750gb
- if one machine can store 75 gb ram then 10 michines required

Latency
- 95% of time 500 ms
- 18000 request per second
- 1 server can have 50 threads
- 1 server can server 100 request/ sec considering 1 request takes 500 ms
- 180 servers will be required to handle this much data
