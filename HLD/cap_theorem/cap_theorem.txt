- This comes at the very beginning of the system design.
- This is a desirable property of a distributed system with replicated data.
- C: consistency, A: availability, P: partition tolerance

- check d1 where there is an application which can make request to different servers persent
  in different countries.

- At a time only two can be selected i.e CA, CP, AP.
- consistency: When a data in node A is changed then it should also reflect in node B.
- availability: all nodes hsould respond.
- Partition tolerance: even after the breakage between servers system should be up.


- why all these cannot be used altogether?
ans: suppose there is a breakage when node A asks node B to update a data so node B will not have
     consistency but Avaialbility and Partition is there.

- now a days partition tolerance is required so we cannot compromise on P.
