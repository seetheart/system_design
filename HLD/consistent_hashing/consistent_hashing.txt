- hashing has a function which converts an arbitraty length value to a fixed length value
  eg mod hashing where one 0-5 values are present to store in a table in d1.

- Why mode hashing cannot be used in load balancer or horizontal sharding?
ans: because if a new node is added in both then the number of mode value will change which will result in the
     change of the hash.  so for eg. if a data which a converted with mod hash with 3 will go to node 1 but if
     a node is added then mod will become 4 or if reduced will become 3 which will result the chagne in the
     hash so all the data of previous node needs to be moved to the new node.

- Consistent hashing comes to solve this problem. to reduce the rebalancing to 1/n% of total number of nodes.
  rebalancing is the moving of the data to another node if a new node of added or previous node deleted.

- Consistent hashing is creating a virtual ring and distributing all the servers equally distant now if the new server
  is added the only few request are going to change. d2

- disadvantabe of consistent hashing
  if all the nodes are adjavcent then all the keys will go to the same. d3

- Solution for above problem
  make the virtual servers at more places in d4
